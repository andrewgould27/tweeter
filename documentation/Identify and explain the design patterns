Design patterns for the design section and how we apply them.
We used structural design patterns to create the project 3. After a few hours of group chat, we fully developed what we want to create for the project 3, which is a chat room that similar with GroupMe or Tweeter, we can login, signup, chat to another person, can click the like button for message and so on. We fully developed the goal and have general understanding about what we are going to do, therefore the structural design patterns are the most suitable way to approach. We can use the structural patterns to explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures even we still was in blueprint stage, the structural patterns can help us explain lots of steps while still keeping the structures flexible, easier to fix and change afterward and keep us focus on the task, which is very efficient pattern to use.
We can easily convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, the feature of adapter can make classes work together instead of separate because of the interfaces aren’t compatible, our group design a very perfect interface by the structural design pattern.
Furthermore, this patterns’ decorator makes us attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically while keeping the same interface, it also provides flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. 
Compare with the behavioral design patterns, we aren’t going to have the need to redefine algorithm’s structure in general, the necessary of alter an object’s behavior when internal state changes are down to zero. Creational design pattern is also having less advantage compare with the structural one. Therefore, the structural design pattern is more suitable for out project.
